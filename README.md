# Overview

In this project, I developed a to-do list manager software using C++. The software allows users to create, view, edit, and delete tasks in a to-do list. The primary purpose of this project was to demonstrate my proficiency in the C++ programming language and to further my understanding of software development concepts.

# Development Environment

The tools used to develop the software include:
- Visual Studio Code: Used as the integrated development environment (IDE) for writing and editing C++ code.
- C++ Programming Language: The primary language used for coding the software.
- Standard Template Library (STL): Utilized for data structures and algorithms implementations.

# Useful Websites

During the development process, the following websites were helpful:
- [cplusplus.com](http://www.cplusplus.com/): Provided comprehensive documentation and tutorials on C++ programming language.
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/): Useful for finding solutions to specific programming problems and debugging issues.

# Future Work

For future iterations of the software, the following improvements and additions could be considered:
- Implement user authentication and multiple user support.
- Add support for recurring tasks and reminders.
- Improve user interface with graphical elements for a better user experience.
- Implement data encryption for better security of user data.
- Enhance error handling and input validation to provide a more robust user experience.
